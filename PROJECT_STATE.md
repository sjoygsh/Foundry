# Foundry Project State

**Last updated:** 2026-09-03
**Updated by:** M0 — `platform` (L1) complete with both backends; a window opens on macOS

This document changes every session. Durable principles live in `CLAUDE.md`; individual
decisions live in `docs/adr/`; milestone definitions live in `docs/ROADMAP.md`.

## Repository

**Canonical home: `github.com/sjoygsh/Foundry`** — public, Apache-2.0, established
2026-09-02. This repository is the engine, its tools, its samples and its documentation.
Games live in their own repositories and consume Foundry as a dependency (ADR-0017).

No CI, release automation or contribution infrastructure yet; those arrive when the project
is mature enough to need them rather than as decoration.

## Current phase

**Phase 1 — Foundation.**

## Current milestone

**M0 — Skeleton: "it runs."** In progress. Setup, design docs, the build graph, `core` and
`platform` (both backends) are done. Next is `app`.

**A window now opens on macOS with a live `CAMetalLayer`** — half of M0's exit criteria,
though only from a throwaway probe so far. `app` and `samples/sandbox` are what make it a
runnable result the repository actually contains.

Target: a window that opens and responds to input on macOS, a fixed-timestep loop, `core`
primitives, a null RHI backend, and cross-compilation checks for Windows and Linux. Full
definition and exit criteria in `docs/ROADMAP.md`.

---

## What has been implemented

**`core` (L0) and `platform` (L1). No renderer, and nothing yet opens a window.**

New this session:

* `engine/src/platform/` — the whole L1 interface plus the null backend:
  * `key.zig` — keys by physical position, `KeySet`, mouse buttons, modifiers.
  * `event.zig` — Foundry's own event union; text input carried by value.
  * `input.zig` — the per-frame `InputSnapshot` and the `Accumulator` that builds it.
  * `window.zig` — `WindowHandle`, logical vs pixel size, `NativeSurfaceHandle`.
  * `os.zig` — filesystem, base directories, environment, wall clock. Owns `std.Io`.
  * `library.zig` — dynamic library loading, including Foundry's own Win32 bindings.
  * `interface.zig` — the backend interface and its `comptime` conformance check.
  * `backends/null.zig` — the headless backend, with a scriptable event queue and an
    exactly-reproducible synthetic clock.
  * `backends/sdl3.zig` — the SDL3 backend. **The only file in Foundry that may name an
    SDL type**, and the build graph is what enforces that: no other module is linked
    against SDL.
* `build.zig` — `platform` added to the layering table; `-Dplatform=null|sdl3` selects the
  backend, and the lazy SDL dependency is linked into that one module and nowhere else.
* `scripts/check-targets.sh` — now runs both backends natively and cross-compiles both for
  Windows and Linux: six combinations, all green.
* `core/handle.zig` — `HandlePool` now takes a **tag type and a value type**
  (`HandlePool(Window, WindowState)`). See "decisions" below.
* `docs/design/platform-interface.md` — Resolution section recording what implementation
  changed about the design, and why.

Earlier sessions: pinned toolchain (`scripts/install-zig.sh`, `.zigversion`), the SDL3
dependency and its licence entry, ADRs 0001–0017, `core` (L0), `scripts/check-targets.sh`,
and the published repository.

## What currently works

**`zig build test` passes 109 tests** with the default null backend (50 `core`, 59
`platform`), and **117 with `-Dplatform=sdl3`** (the 8 extra cover the scancode, button and
modifier mappings). The SDL3 tests are headless by design — nothing in the suite calls
`SDL_Init` — so they run anywhere. `scripts/check-targets.sh` runs the whole per-milestone
obligation for both backends against both cross-targets.

**A window opens on macOS.** Verified live by a throwaway probe, not merely compiled: SDL3
3.4.14 under the `cocoa` video driver, a window reporting **logical 800x600, pixel
1600x1200, scale 2**, a live `CAMetalLayer` delivered upward as an opaque
`NativeSurfaceHandle`, and 1500ms of real time driving exactly 90 simulation steps at 60Hz.
The probe was scratch work and is not in the repository — `samples/sandbox` is where this
becomes a runnable result Foundry actually ships.

**Both backends cross-compile to Windows and Linux, SDL included.** ADR-0008's "supported
means compiles" claim therefore covers the backend that actually ships, not only the
headless one — a better outcome than that ADR assumed was available.

**Four guarantees were verified by breaking them on purpose**, not by assertion:

| Claim | How it was checked |
| --- | --- |
| Layering (I7) | `platform` importing `rhi`, and `core` importing `platform`, both fail with *no module named X available within module 'root'* |
| Conformance | A backend missing a function, with a wrong signature, or with no `Platform` type each fails with a message naming the backend and the declaration |
| Windows really compiles | Breaking only the Win32 loader branch fails `zig build check -Dtarget=x86_64-windows-gnu` and no other target |
| Determinism (I9) | The same event sequence yields byte-identical snapshots; the synthetic clock drives a fixed-timestep loop to the same step count every run |

## What is being worked on

Nothing in progress. The next session continues M0 at step 1 below.

---

## Immediate next steps

1. **Implement `app`**: fixed-timestep loop (drive it with `core.time.FixedStepper`, which
   already exists and is tested), subsystem lifecycle, clean shutdown. `app` owns `main`,
   so it is where the process environment is captured and handed to `platform.Os` — see
   "the environment is an input" below.
2. **Define the `rhi` interface and write the null backend.** Interface shape matters far
   more than the backend at this stage.
3. **Build `samples/sandbox`** to M0's exit criteria. The probe described above is
   effectively its skeleton; it needs `app` underneath it rather than driving `platform`
   directly.

Before M1, and before any Metal code: **`docs/design/rhi.md`**, including the Metal / Vulkan /
D3D12 concept mapping table from ADR-0003. This is the highest-leverage document in the project.

---

## Known bugs and technical debt

* **`core.log` still formats through `std.log`'s default handler.** `app` will need to
  install a real log sink: destination, timestamps, runtime filtering by scope. The
  interface is right; the backend behind it is temporary.
* **The handle pool is sparse and iterates dead slots.** Fine for its intended use — lookup
  by identity, rare iteration. Deliberately not optimised, and deliberately not generalised
  toward component storage (ADR-0010, M4).
* **`platform` has no gamepad support, file watching, IME preedit or audio.** Each is
  deferred with a recorded reason in the design doc's Resolution; none requires the
  interface to change to accommodate it later.
* **Text input is enabled for a window's whole lifetime.** SDL3 requires
  `SDL_StartTextInput` explicitly, and without it `text_input` events never arrive at all.
  Per-window IME control belongs with the UI system (M6).
* **Only `metal_layer` surfaces are implemented.** `win32_hwnd` and the X11/Wayland kinds
  return `SurfaceUnavailable`. SDL can produce an `HWND` through its properties API, but
  there is no backend to consume one and no way to test it.
* **Reading a directory as a file reports `IoFailed`, not `WrongFileKind`,** because macOS
  opens the directory happily and fails at the read. The test asserts only that it errors.
  Classifying it would cost a `stat` on every read, which is not worth it.
* **The RHI will be validated by exactly one backend for a long time.** ADR-0003's
  mitigations (design to the strict model, null backend as validator) reduce this but do
  not remove it. Expect backend #2 to find design errors.
* **SDL3 arrives through a third-party build script** that can bitrot against a future
  pinned Zig release. Checking it is part of the cost of every Zig upgrade. Fallbacks in
  ADR-0002.
* Shaders will need per-backend variants when a second backend lands (ADR-0015).
* Sparse-set entity storage (M4) is explicitly a first implementation, not a final one.
* The first content authoring format may need replacing once real content exists at scale.
  ADR-0006 contains this by separating schemas from syntax.

---

## Important decisions made recently

**This session:**

* **`platform` splits into `Platform` and `Os`.** `Platform` is what a windowing backend
  changes — window, surface, events, input, monotonic clock — and is conformance-checked.
  `Os` is what it does not — filesystem, base directories, dynamic libraries, wall clock —
  and sits beside the seam rather than behind it. A hand-written Cocoa backend and a
  hand-written Win32 backend would share `os.zig` byte for byte.
* **`std.Io` stops at L1.** Zig 0.16 finished its I/O migration: `std.fs` is a deprecation
  shim over `std.Io.Dir`, every filesystem call takes an explicit `Io`, and
  `std.time.Instant` is gone. `Os` owns one `std.Io.Threaded` and never lets it out, so no
  `std` type appears in any Foundry interface. ADR-0001's containment argument, applied to
  the module whose job is owning OS specifics.
* **The environment is an input, never read from the air.** Zig 0.16 removed ambient
  environment access entirely (`std.posix.getenv`, `std.os.environ`,
  `std.process.getEnvVarOwned` are all gone) and hands the environment to the process entry
  point. `Os.init` takes the variables it may see. This is the better design regardless:
  configuration read from the air is exactly the hidden input I9 objects to, and it makes
  the environment-dependent paths testable without touching the real machine.
* **Foundry declares the Windows dynamic loader itself.** `std.DynLib` is a compile error on
  Windows in Zig 0.16, and `std.os.windows.kernel32` has been stripped to one binding.
  Windows is a supported target (ADR-0008) and native mods are fundamental (`CLAUDE.md` §5),
  so `library.zig` declares `LoadLibraryW`, `GetProcAddress` and `FreeLibrary` directly.
* **`core.HandlePool` now takes a tag type and a value type.** `HandlePool(Window,
  WindowState)` — a subsystem exposes a public handle over private state, and deriving the
  handle type from the stored type would either leak the private type into the public
  interface or force a cast at every boundary. Found by the first real consumer, which is
  when you want to find it. `HandlePool(T, T)` covers the simple case.
* **Path validation is in force before there are any mods.** `isSafeRelativePath` rejects
  absolute paths, drive letters, backslashes, `..` components and embedded NULs. Retrofitting
  this after untrusted paths are already flowing means auditing every call site instead of one.
* **`readFile` requires a size bound.** Every caller knows roughly how big the thing it is
  reading should be, and a content package naming a hundred-gigabyte file should fail rather
  than exhaust memory. Untrusted input is bounded at the boundary, not after it.
* **The frame's event boundary is three calls** — `pumpEvents`, `nextEvent`, `captureInput` —
  rather than one polling call that pumps on first use. It makes "the OS queue is drained at
  one known point" structural rather than conventional, and gives the snapshot an
  unambiguous place to be taken.

* **SDL's several resize events collapse into Foundry's one.** SDL reports logical resize,
  pixel-size change and display-scale change separately, and one drag between monitors can
  produce all three. Every consumer reacts identically, so they become a single
  `window_resized` carrying both sizes — emitted only when something actually changed,
  which also avoids redundant swapchain rebuilds.
* **The SDL3 backend needed no interface changes.** The interface was designed by asking
  "would this be right for hand-written Cocoa and Win32?", and SDL fitted inside it rather
  than the other way round. That is the outcome ADR-0002's named risk was worried about.

**Earlier sessions:** pinned Zig 0.16.0 (ADR-0001 resolution); SDL3 via `castholm/SDL`
(ADR-0002 resolution); HIDAPI licence elected BSD-3-Clause; the build graph as a data table;
handles are `extern struct` with an all-zero null; FNV-1a 64 and PCG32 specified in the
design docs rather than delegated to `std`; simulation time is an integer tick count;
input is captured into a per-frame immutable snapshot; the engine gets its own public
repository (ADR-0017). Before that, sixteen ADRs establishing the architecture.

## Major unresolved questions

1. **RHI granularity.** To be settled in `docs/design/rhi.md`: how coarse the resource-group
   / binding model should be, and how explicitly resource state transitions are expressed
   given that Metal will ignore them. Too abstract and Vulkan cannot implement it
   efficiently; too thin and the Metal backend carries pointless ceremony.
2. **What "package zero" means for the engine itself.** Does the engine ship content of its
   own — default font, error texture, fallback shader — as a real content package? Probably
   yes, and it is a good early test of Invariant I3. Decide during M3.
3. **Authoring format syntax.** Postponed to M3 by ADR-0006. Requirements recorded;
   candidates are adopting an existing format versus a small purpose-built one.
4. **Zig upgrade cadence.** ADR-0001 says between milestones, never during. Whether that
   means *every* milestone boundary or only when there is a reason is still unresolved. Two
   concrete inputs now: each upgrade must re-verify the SDL3 port, and 0.16 showed that a
   single release can move `std.fs`, the clock and dynamic library loading at once.
5. **When backend #2 is triggered.** Deliberately unscheduled (ADR-0003). The trigger is a
   reason, not a date — but it is worth noticing if that reason never arrives, since the RHI
   stays unvalidated until it does.

## Notes for the next session

* Read `CLAUDE.md` first, then this file, then `docs/ROADMAP.md`.
* The architecture is settled. Do not relitigate ADRs without a concrete reason; each records
  the conditions that would justify revisiting it.
* Sessions are bounded by available context, not calendar time. Prefer finishing a coherent
  piece and updating this file over leaving several things half-built.

**Zig 0.16 behaviours worth not rediscovering.** All confirmed against the pinned compiler:

* **`std.fs` is a deprecation shim.** The real API is `std.Io.Dir` / `std.Io.File`, and every
  call takes an explicit `Io`. `std.time` has only constants — no `Instant`, no
  `nanoTimestamp`. Get an `Io` from `std.Io.Threaded.init(gpa, .{})` then `.io()`; in tests,
  `std.testing.io` already exists.
* **Ambient environment access is gone.** `pub fn main(init: std.process.Init) !void` is how
  a program receives `gpa`, `io`, `environ_map` and `args`.
* **`std.DynLib` does not support Windows.** Its backing type resolves to a stub whose `open`
  is `@compileError("unsupported platform")`. `platform/library.zig` works around it.
* **A file imported only for its types contributes no tests.** Zig collects tests from files
  reached through a test block, so `os.zig` importing `library.zig` for `Library` did *not*
  pull in its tests — they silently never ran. Every file gets an explicit `_ =` line in its
  module root's test block. This is the same lazy-analysis family as the layering nuance.
* **Lazy analysis makes negative tests lie.** A function body is only analysed when something
  reaches it, and an *undeclared identifier* is caught earlier than a *type error*, so a
  probe using the former proves nothing about branch analysis. Break things with a genuine
  type mismatch, and check the failure lands on the target you expect and not on others.
* **The build test runner reprints a command as "failed" when a test logs at `warn` or
  above**, while the build still exits 0. Two tests do this deliberately (handle generation
  wraparound, and an unclassifiable OS read error). Noise, not failure — check the exit code
  and the `Build Summary` line.
* **`.lazy = true` still extracts a dependency into `zig-pkg/`** on every build; it governs
  how `build.zig` must ask for it (`b.lazyDependency`, returning an optional), not whether it
  is materialised. `zig-pkg/` is build output and is gitignored.
* Modules are created with `b.addModule` / `b.createModule` and wired through `.imports`;
  `addExecutable` and `addTest` take a `.root_module`; `build.zig.zon` requires `.fingerprint`
  and its `.name` is an enum literal. `b.addOptions()` emits its *own* definition of any enum
  passed to `addOption`, which is not the same type as the one the module declares — pass the
  name as a string and convert it back at comptime.

**Reference development environment**, which the verification above was performed against:
Apple Silicon, macOS 26, Xcode 26 with SDK 26.5, Zig 0.16.0. The Metal toolchain is always
invoked via `xcrun`, never a hardcoded path — it lives on a versioned mount that moves between
updates. Homebrew may exist on a developer's machine but nothing in Foundry may assume it.

`scripts/install-zig.sh` places Zig at `~/.local/zig/<version>` and symlinks `~/.local/bin/zig`.
If `~/.local/bin` is not on `PATH`, add it:
`echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc`
